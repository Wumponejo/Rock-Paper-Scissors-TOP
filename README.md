# Rock-Paper-Scissors-TOP

Forgot to commit, bad practice. Not happening again,

Here is everything untill game function, in which i'm struggling a lot: loops are kinda complicate so far.

Forgot to commit again, college stuff's made me not work in anything related to TOP for a long time. I hope this is the last time that happens.

With this new index everything works and it's functional separately, but using both playround and Game functions generate problems since the variables for 
rounds won by the computer and the player don't reset after being used in one or the other, i'll be working a little on trying to fix this situation:
i have some ideas that may work, but for now i'd like to advance for the next steps of top and see if i can finally finish the foundations.

The second index is wrong and uncomplete, it's just there to remember how much i was strugglin with it.
